### General Instructions
- Use a Markdown editor such as VSCode to keep notes and observations. Avoid MS Word because it is difficult to track changes.
- Use a private (or public) GitHub repo to share/update the .md file. My github userID is kwic1975
- Use MS Excel, Google Sheets, Python w/Pandas for any quantitative work. Save a copy of your results in csv file.
- Whenever possible use Bloomberg as the primary source of Financial Data. Quote the source of your data.

### General Approach
- With the exception of an introductory call to go over these notes, exchange communication in writing. e.g. Ask a question in writing, Respond to a question in writing. I will do likewise.
- Write down your expectations from this exercise. Include your rationale for choosing PEP as the company to analyze.
- Before reading any Pepsico financial statements, annual reports, write your understanding of PepsiCo as a business. How does it make money? Where does the money come from? Where is money spent? Where does it recruit it's personnel from? What do you know about PepsiCo's management? What does the "internet" say about Pepsi in sites like quora, linkedin, reddit, instagram, glassdoor, wikipedia etc. Do you see any similarity between algorithmic trading and PepsiCo? After you have compeleted the financial analysis we will revisit the same questions above. We will compare answers on a "before" and "after" basis.
