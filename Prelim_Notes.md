### Preliminary Notes

# What is this excercise for?
* Exploring company analysis techniques, i.e., learning fundamental techniques used in industry.
* The company I chose to analyze was Pepsico because I wanted to start something in the consumer staples sector. I know it is a multinational conglomerate so it would be interesting to study because I expect it to be heavily affected by macroeconomic events.
